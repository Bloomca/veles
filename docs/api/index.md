## Design principles

Veles' main design principle is to have few APIs to avoid the problem where powerful libraries are hard to properly use, and also to be as explicit as possible. For example, Veles doesn't use [Proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) and requires to specify what type of subscription you want.
